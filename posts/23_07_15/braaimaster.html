    <h1>The Braaiometer - Part 1</h1>
    <h4>23 July 2015</h2>

    <div>
      <p>As a South African I take my braaing (or barbequeing for lesser mortals) very seriously. Every now and again I will be having a braai and the odds are significantly stacked against me. Either I am dealing with terrible quality steaks or I have conversationally needy guests which distract me from my braai duty. In any event, these conditions result in shamefully poor meal that takes me a few days to get over. </p>

<p>As a person that on some level believes that tech can help us overcome almost any challenge I began developing a device to help me ensure that my braais are always a success no matter what environmental or social challenges might stand in my way. It didn’t take much brain storming to come up with a simple solution to my problem. What I needed was a way to measure the temperature coming from the fire, a way to measure the internal temperature of the meat and some kind of simple computing device to apply some logic to these values. This knowledge will allow me to make sure heat coming from the flames is always optimum and less variable. It also allows me to know the exact time to turn the meat to allow for equal cooking on each side of the meat based on the temperature gradient of the meat. These were the core features but the fact is that as soon as these values become digital, they can be used to power some other really cool features that I will discuss in a later blog. But to start of with all I wanted was to be able to measure the temperature of the meat and the heat coming from the flames and some way to notify me when either went above a certain threshold. </p>

<p>So to achieve this I decided I would use an arduino with a thermocouple to do the temperature measuring and initial processing and ship that data of to an iOS device using Bluetooth LE. The iOS device will be used for futher processing, display and notification of the temperature data.  </p>

<p>As a result of this being a side project I decided to break it up into mini projects that split out the work load into smaller achievable projects to avoid the <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/">side project curse </a>. This very conveniently splits into smaller blog posts… so everyone wins. </p>

<p>The first project would involve simply getting the arduino setup with the thermocouple and displaying the current temperature on some kind of display. These are the components I needed. </p>

<ol>
<li>Arduino Uno</li>
<li>LCD Display</li>
<li>Type-K glass <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/270">thermocouple</a></li>
<li>Thermocouple amplifier MAX31855 breakout board </li>
<li>poteniometer</li>
</ol>

<p>Wiring everything up was quite straight forward. Adafruit has a great <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/thermocouple/">tutorial</a>  that tells you everything you need to know about the thermocouple and the thermocouple amplifier. The LCD display was wired up using a tutorial from the Arduino Uno Getting Started book. Together I was able to hook everything up and start thinking about what the code was going to look like. </p>

<p>Adafruit provide a nice example project that also uses the lcd display as output for the temperature. That meant that I could just copy the code over and make sure my thermocouple and lcd declarations were passed in the right pin numbers. I also had change my baud rate to 9600 as the example baud rate printed out gibberish. </p>

<p>And that was all it took to set this up. What I thought was going to be a weekend project only took a few hours. In order to proove that everything was working correctly I needed to do some rigorous testing…</p>

<p>The next phase is adding the bluetooth shield and printing out the thermocouple temperature on an iphone. Stay tuned. </p>
